This repository contains my journey in Data Analysis, including:

2. Hands-on analysis projects and case studies related to Masco Group, focusing on insights into supply chain, productivity, quality, and more.
3. Tools and technologies include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

Aimed at improving decision-making and data-driven problem-solving skills while exploring the practical applications of data analysis in the private industry. ðŸš€
